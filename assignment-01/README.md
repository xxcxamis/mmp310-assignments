# Multimedia Programming II (MMP 310)
## Assignment 1
Spring 2017
Instructor: Roy Vanegas

## Description
Your are to make `index.html` look exactly like `original-image.png` by implementing the CSS to achieve this in the file called `style.css`, which is inside the `css` folder. The HTML component is already in place; you only need to implement the CSS. A perfect project will look almost identical to the original image.

## Rules
* You may not modify `index.html`’s contents or its file name; you must leave the file in tact.
* You may only write CSS.
* Except for a warning about UTF-8, your CSS must validate at [http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
* Your CSS code must be neat and legible.
* You may not touch the directory structure of the project.
